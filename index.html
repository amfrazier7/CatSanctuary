                    <h3><a name ="aboutUs"></a>About the Cat Sanctuary</h3>
                    <p>Thanks for visiting our site!  The Cat Sanctuary is an organization that specializes in rescue, adpotion, and spaying/neutering of stray cats and kittens in the Jeffersonville and Clarksville Indiana area.  We partner with local shelters such as <a href = "https://www.apa-pets.org">APA</a> and <a href="http://www.jbogleanimalshelter.com/">J.B. Ogle Animal Shelter</a> to help control and manage the feline population.</p>
                    <p>We were founded in 2014 by Angie Frazier, and since then we have managed to rescue over 61 adult cats and 115 kittens.  We have also been able to successfully spay and neuter 100% of all rescues not already spayed/neutered.  Rescues are either fostered or temporarily placed in area shelters until forever homes can be found.  We rely solely on volunteers and donations; we do not receive any state, county, or city funding to support our cause.</p>
